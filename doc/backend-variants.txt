Possible backend designs.

1. trampolining, allocate closures as objects, argvecs are vectors

	- safe for space
	- slow!
	- totally typeless
	- dynamic-wind layered atop

2. general tco by frame counting + exception; regular calling otherwise
   with continuation capture by exception

	- possibly slow because of the exception-handlers
	- safe for space recoverable only by mutation of dead bindings
	  to null
	- dynamic-wind integrable?
