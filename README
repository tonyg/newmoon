This is Newmoon, a very very simple CPS compiler for a language
asymptotically approaching R5RS Scheme. The compiler currently targets
the JVM, Microsoft's CLR ("dotnet") and a custom C runtime. Previously
an ad-hoc bytecode machine was targeted; the layering is clean enough
that retargeting ought to be minimally painful.

This is all the documentation you will find at the moment. More will
be forthcoming.
